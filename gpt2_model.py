# gpt2_model.py
# This script sets up the GPT-2 model for text generation.

# Import necessary classes from the Transformers library
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel

# Define the model name to be used (in this case, "gpt2")
model_name = "gpt2"

# Initialize the tokenizer for the GPT-2 model
# The tokenizer converts text into numerical tokens that the model can understand
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Initialize the GPT-2 model itself (Lightweight version with 124 million parameters)
# GPT2LMHeadModel is a class for language modeling tasks (text generation)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Note: The Hugging Face library provides the GPT-2 model and tokenizer for easy integration.
# The model can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, and its outputs can be generated.
# In this script, we're using the pre-trained GPT-2 model without any fine-tuning.

# The 'fine_tuned_model' folder is typically created during the fine-tuning process,
# when you train the GPT-2 model on a specific dataset. It contains the fine-tuned model
# weights and configuration.
